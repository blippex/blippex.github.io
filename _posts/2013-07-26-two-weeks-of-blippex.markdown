Two weeks after launching [Blippex](https://www.blippex.org/) we are still blown away by the usage and feedback! 

Blippex was covered again on [GigaOM](http://gigaom.com/2013/07/25/how-blippex-handles-the-data-behind-its-time-driven-search-engine//) and many other blogs and a there are a lot of discussions (for example [here in russian](http://habrahabr.ru/post/187088/)) going on. Last week I wrote about 125k searches, this week we have a total of 450k!<!-- more -->

**Thank you all for the great support, please keep on installing the extension to make Blippex better!**

Blippex has served over 325 000 searches this week only, **thats 260% more than last week!** Here is a graph of the number of searches per day (you can always see the latest version [here](https://www.blippex.org/status))

Blippex is now serving on average 46 000 searches per day, thats fantastic!

**Again, we don’t stop there!**

On Tuesday we have [released the first dump of our database](http://blippex.github.io/updates/2013/07/23/First-database-dump.html), and had some very interesting discussions & ideas on how to use this data.
[@wolfhesse](https://twitter.com/wolfhesse/status/360426512316514305) wanted to know the number of unique domains in our database and [extracted 231 435 different domains](https://github.com/wolfhesse/r20130523/blob/master/data.d/rel.r.d/export.roots.r20130725.lst.gz), great job! We will release a dump every month, if you have any ideas how to make it better please tell us!

Beside the upcoming Windows 8 (Phone & Desktop apps, **Betatesters needed!**) we will release next week something very exiting for developers, stay tuned!

And finally: To help improve Blippex, please tell your friends! The more people who are a part of the community, the better it will get for everyone!

**Thank you &amp; keep on searching & discussing!**
