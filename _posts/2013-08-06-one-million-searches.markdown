In less than four weeks [Blippex](https://www.blippex.org) has, today, reached the goal of **one million searches** served! And there's more. Yesterday we served a [new record of 66 562 searches](https://www.blippex.org/status) and today we hope to break that record again.<!-- more -->

**This is awesome!** We are completely blown away, and all this is because of you. Without your outstanding contribution, we wouldn't have thousends of people using the browser extension and sharing their URLs. If you haven't done that yet, please consider [doing so](https://www.blippex.org/extension).

Thank you,  
The Blippex Team
