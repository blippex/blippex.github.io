In less than four weeks [Blippex](https://www.blippex.org)  has, today, reached the goal of **one million searches** served!

And this is not the end, yesterday, Monday, Blippex served a [new record of searches](https://www.blippex.org/status),  of 66 562 searches and today we hope to break that record again!

**This is awesome!**

We are completely blown away by this and can just say:

Keep on searching & discussing & installing the extension, together we can change search forever!

Thank you,  
The Blippex Team
