In less than four weeks [Blippex](https://www.blippex.org) reached today the goal of **one million searches** served!

And this is not the end, yesterday, Monday, Blippex served a [new record of searches](https://www.blippex.org/status), 66 562 and today we hope we will break this record again!

**This is awesome!**

We are completly blown away by this and can just say:

Keep on searching & discussing & installing the extension, together we can change search forever!

Thank you,  
The Blippex Team
