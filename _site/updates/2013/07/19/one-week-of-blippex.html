	<h2>One week of Blippex—125k+ searches, tons of press and a search-overlay!</h2>
	<p>One week ago we launched <a href='https://www.blippex.org/'>Blippex</a> to start a discussion, and boy, we were blown away from the usage and feedback! Blippex was covered on <a href='http://gigaom.com/2013/07/11/privacy-centric-search-engine-blippex-launches-with-a-new-twist-on-ranking/'>GigaOM</a>, <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23318889'>BBC</a>, <a href='http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-11/blippex-a-private-search-engines-new-twist-on-rankings'>Businessweek</a>, <a href='http://venturevillage.eu/archify-launches-blippex'>Venture Village</a> and many other sites. After existing for only one week, the BBC already see us as an alternative to Google, which we never thought ourselves as at this state!<!-- more --></p>

<p><strong>Thank you all for the great support over these past days and of course, keep on searching &#38; browsing!</strong></p>

<p>Blippex has served over 125 000 searches this week. Here is a graph of the number of searches per day</p>

<p><img alt='Searches on Blippex' src='/css/img/posts/searches-per-day.png' /></p>

<p>Just to give you an idea of what this means to us: According to <a href='https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html'>these</a> statistics it took <a href='https://duckduckgo.com/'>DuckDuckGo</a> (our favorite search engine!) nearly 18 months, after the company was founded, to get to around 30 000 searches per day, which we reached in only one week!</p>

<p><strong>But we don’t stop there!</strong></p>

<p>Today we have released new versions of the Chrome, Firefox and Safari extension that include a search overlay. This means every time you search on Google, you also see the three top results from Blippex, makes it easy for you to compare the results and decide where to click!</p>

<p>This is how it looks like:</p>

<p><img alt='Blippex overlay' src='/css/img/posts/blippex-overlay.png' /></p>

<p>The search overlay is available for Chrome, Safari and Firefox, so <a href='https://www.blippex.org/extension'>go get it</a>!</p>

<p>Of course, if you don’t like it you can disable it by unselecting the checkbox in the popup that appears when you click on the Blippex icon in the toolbar.</p>

<p><strong>Wait, there is more to come!</strong></p>

<p>Next week we will release our first database dump (it will be a mongodump, we think for now this is the best method), so everyone can see what is in our index. Also, don’t forget the upcoming Windows 8 (phone &#38; desktop) apps!</p>

<p>And finally: To help improve Blippex, please tell your friends! The more people who are a part of the community, the better it will get for everyone!</p>

<p><strong>Thank you &#38; keep on searching!</strong></p>
