        <p><p>One week ago we launched <a href='https://www.blippex.org/'>Blippex</a> to start a discussion, and boy, we were blown away from the usage and feedback! Blippex was covered on <a href='http://gigaom.com/2013/07/11/privacy-centric-search-engine-blippex-launches-with-a-new-twist-on-ranking/'>GigaOM</a>, <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23318889'>BBC</a>, <a href='http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-11/blippex-a-private-search-engines-new-twist-on-rankings'>Businessweek</a>, <a href='http://venturevillage.eu/archify-launches-blippex'>Venture Village</a> and many other sites. After existing for only one week, the BBC already see us as an alternative to Google, which we never thought ourselves as at this state!</p>

<p>Google’s PageRank has revolutionized search, but over the last ten years it has forced every other search engine to look and act like Google. This has made it almost impossible to establish a better, modern search engine other than Google, granted it’s popularity is the major indicator for it’s quality. Nice for Google, not so nice for healthy competition.</p>
